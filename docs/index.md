## About
The intention for the fivebot project is to grow into a set of, ideally modular, upgrades for the Creality Ender 5 and Ender 5 Pro printers, and if possible also the Ender 5 Plus. Hopefully, in all making it an affordable, relatively fast, and reliable printer that can stay relevant as very capable off-the-shelf core-xy machines are becoming more affordable. Not to compete with the awesome [Zero G](https://zerog.one/) mods, but to provide a different alternative specifically with the following goals and constraints in mind:

* Keep it as cheap/affordable as reasonable
* Use as much stock parts as possible, and add matching hardware
* No modification of the frame
* Make the printer easy to enclose
* Strive to keep it accessible for less experienced modders, minimize use of heat inserts, soldering etc or provide alternatives
*  Provided with Klipper firmware configuration primarily (contributions for other firmares welcome of course)

## Avilable modifications
* [Dual Z motors](dual-z.html) (beta version)

List of planned modifications, roughly in order of priority:

* Core-XY using roller wheels (lots of upgrades, most notably [Mercury One](https://zerog.one
), already exists)
* Stock display case and mount
* Modular toolhead for the stock gantry

And future ideas and improvements:
* Dual Z motors+ sync belt for single stepper driver use
* Belt-driven dual Z with a single motor
* Affordable triple-z setup with linear rods and stock bed
