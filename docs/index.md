## About
The goal for the fivebot project is to develop a set of, ideally modular, upgrades for the Creality Ender 5 and Ender 5 Pro printers, and if possible also the Ender 5 Plus. Hopefully, making it an affordable, relatively fast, and reliable printer that can stay relevant in the rapidly development 3D printer market. 

The intention is in no way to compete with the already existing and awesome [Zero G](https://zerog.one/) mods, but to provide a distinctly different alternatives with the following goals and constraints in mind:

* Keep it as cheap/affordable as reasonable
* Use as much stock parts as possible, and add matching hardware
* No modification of the frame
* Make the printer easy to enclose
* Strive to keep it accessible for less experienced modders, minimize use of heat inserts, soldering etc or provide alternatives
*  Provided with Klipper firmware configuration primarily (contributions for other firmares welcome of course)

## Avilable modifications
* [Dual Z motors](dual-z.html) (beta version)

List of planned modifications, roughly in order of priority:

* Core-XY using stock roller wheels (lots of core-xy mods with rails already exist)
* Stock display case and mount
* Modular toolhead for the stock gantry

And future ideas and improvements:
* Dual Z motors+ sync belt for single stepper driver use
* Belt-driven dual Z with a single motor
* Affordable triple-z setup with linear rods and stock bed
