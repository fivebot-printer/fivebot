## About
The intention for the 5bot is to grow into a modular set of upgrades compatible mainly with the Creality Ender 5 and Ender 5 Pro printers, and where possible also the Ender 5 Plus. Together making an affordable, relatively fast, and reliable printer that can stay relevant as very capable out-of-the-box core-xy machines are becoming more affordable.

Goals/constraints:

* Try to keep it as cheap/affordable as reasonable
* Try to use as much stock parts as possible
* Try to keep it simple for less experienced modders
* Provided with Klipper firmware configuration primarily, contributions for other firmares welcome

## Avilable modifications
* [Dual Z](dual-z.html) (beta version)

List of planned modifications, roughly in order of priority:

* Dual Z motors
* Core-XY using roller wheels (lots of upgrades, most notably [Mercury One](https://zerog.one
), already exists)
* Modular toolhead for the stock gantry

And future ideas and improvements:
* Belt to keep dual z motors in sync with a single driver
* Belt-driven dual Z with a single motor
* Affordable triple-z setup
